# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Using a medical cost personal data set containing information on individual medical insurance prices, a linear model is constructed that, with certain knowledge about patients, can estimate the insurance cost of their treatment.

In this project, I have built a Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model to forecast insurance bill using [Medical cost dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). The dataset consists of age, sex, BMI(body mass index), children, smoker and region features, which are independent and charges as a dependent feature.

After performing EDA, model building and model validation, a detailed explanation based on the model's statistical parameters has also been provided at the end.

Have a look and enjoy!
